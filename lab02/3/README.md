Skills: use of printf/scanf. Use of float values. Use of switch statement. Usage of functions.
Text: Write a “calculator” in C that is able to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition,
subtraction, division and multiplication) on two given inputs op1 and op2.
Write a C program that:
a) Acquires a character from keyboard using getchar (either ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’ or ‘/’) to decide
which should be the arithmetic operation to perform;
b) Acquires two float operands (ex. 21.0 and 2.0) from keyboard, using scanf.
c) Prints the selected operator on the screen, followed by the result of the operation (for
example: / 10.50).
d) Bonus item: define each operation as a function.
e) Careful: What happens if op2 is 0? How do you handle the problem?
